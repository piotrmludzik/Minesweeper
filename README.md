# Minesweeper


## Description
Remember the classic Minesweeper game? This application is an attempt to write Minesweeper in a clean JavaScript code.
It is a simple WEB application, without server parts. It includes all the basic functions and implements the original
graphics.

The application was created as a task at [CodeCool](https://codecool.com/en/) school. A description of the task
as well as additional information can be found here: [Exercise](https://github.com/piotrmludzik/minesweeper/wiki/Exercise).
Learning programming while writing your favorite game is a great pleasure!
